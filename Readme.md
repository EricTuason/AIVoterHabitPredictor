# Voting Habits Predictor

Our project is about predicting voting frequency based on 4 pieces of demographic information: education, race, gender, and income. 


## Dataset Files
Our dataset can be found in the root directory, called `nonvoters_dataset.csv`. Our dataset exploration procedure and model tuning procedure can be found in the root directory as `nonvoters.ipynb`.

## Front End 
Our front end was made using Flask and all relevant files can be found in the `nonvoters` directory. In order to invoke our model using the front end you can run `app.py` in the `nonvoters` directory. Afterward, you can visit our site [here](http://localhost:9999).
